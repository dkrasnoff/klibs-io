It helps developers discover Kotlin libraries that work across multiple platforms such as Android, iOS, JVM, JS, and WASM. The website is designed to make library evaluation easier by bringing together KMP-related information in one place. When library metadata is incomplete, klibs.io may generate additional metadata for libraries using AI to improve search and their discoverability. However, the content of libraries is not used to train or fine-tune language models. Join #klibs-io on Slack to follow updates!"
