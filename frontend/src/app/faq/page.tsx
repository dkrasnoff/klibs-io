                    <h4>What is klibs.io?</h4>
                    <p>
                        klibs.io is a search platform and catalog for Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) libraries. It helps
                        developers discover Kotlin libraries that work across multiple platforms such as Android, iOS,
                        JVM, JS, and WASM. The website is designed to make library evaluation easier by bringing
                        together KMP-related information in one place.
                        <br/><br/>

                        When library metadata is incomplete, klibs.io may generate additional metadata for libraries
                        using AI to improve search and their discoverability. However, the content of libraries is not
                        used to train or fine-tune language models.

                            If your project is already presented in the klibs.io,
                            then new versions should appear the <b>next day</b> after
                            they are published to Maven Central.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you believe your project satisfies all criteria, yet it&apos;s still not

                    <h4>How are libraries selected or ranked on klibs.io?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Libraries on klibs.io are discovered from public package repositories and code hosting
                        platforms. Ranking may consider factors such as relevance to your query, popularity, and project
                        activity. The ranking logic can evolve over time as the platform improves.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id='oss-health'>How is the OSS Health score calculated?</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The OSS Health score is a number from <b>0 to 100</b> that estimates how actively and
                            sustainably a project is maintained on GitHub, based on its activity over the
                            last <b>12 weeks</b>. It combines four signals, each scored from 0 to 1:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Commit consistency (30%)</b> — how regular the commit activity is from week to week.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Issue responsiveness (25%)</b> — what share of issues get closed, and how quickly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Pull request management (25%)</b> — what share of pull requests get merged, and how
                                quickly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Author diversity (20%)</b> — how many people contribute, and how evenly the work is
                                spread across them (the &quot;bus factor&quot;).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The signals are combined with a weighted sum:
                            <br/>
                            <code>OSS Health = 100 × (0.30·C + 0.25·I + 0.25·P + 0.20·A)</code>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When a project doesn&apos;t have enough recent activity to compute one of the signals, the
                            score is shown as &quot;—&quot; rather than a potentially misleading number. The methodology
                            is inspired by academic work on <a href={REPOSITORY_STABILITY_PAPER_URL} target="_blank"
                            className={"link-secondary"}>repository stability</a>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Are there any licensing or usage considerations when using libraries listed on klibs.io?</h4>
                    <p>
                        klibs.io is only a discovery tool. When you use a library, you must follow that library’s
                        license terms, just as if you had found it directly on GitHub or Maven Central.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Where can I find tutorials or examples of using KMP libraries from klibs.io?</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are looking for tutorials or example projects that demonstrate how Kotlin Multiplatform
                        libraries can be used in practice, see the curated list of Kotlin Multiplatform samples in <a
                        href={'https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform/multiplatform-samples.html'}>the Kotlin
                        documentation</a>. These examples show common project structures and practical use cases
                        across multiple platforms.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Will GitLab/Bitbucket be indexed?</h4>
                    <p>
                        GitLab and Bitbucket should be supported at some point, but for now we want to focus
                        on validating our ideas and iterating quickly. Adding support for GitLab and Bitbucket
                        would slow us down, while not giving much in return, as 95% of KMP projects already use
                        GitHub.
                    </p>


                    <h4>Will Gradle plugins be indexed?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Gradle Plugins should be indexed at some point as they provide a lot of value to Kotlin
                        Multiplatform projects and libraries. They will likely have a separate category
                        like &quot;Tools&quot;.
                    </p>


                    <h4>What about Java/JVM-only packages?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We would like to add them in the future.
